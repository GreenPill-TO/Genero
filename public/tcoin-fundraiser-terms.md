### T-Coin Inaugural Mint Fundraiser Terms and Conditions
These terms provide a foundational structure for transparency, user rights, and general responsibilities involved in the inaugural T-Coin fundraiser.

**1. Overview**
   - This fundraiser offers participants the opportunity to pre-purchase T-Coins, the new local currency of Toronto, during the initial minting stage. Funds raised will support the establishment of the T-Coin ecosystem, including operational costs, partnerships, and community programs.

**2. Eligibility**
   - Participants must be at least 18 years old and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.
   - Participants must be residents of Canada.
   - This fundraiser is open to individuals, entities, and organizations that meet these requirements.

**3. Token Generation and Allocation**
   - The fundraiser involves the initial creation (Token Generation Event) and allocation of T-Coins to participants.
   - The token allocation will be based on the contribution amount, with each participant receiving an amount of T-Coins commensurate with their support level and time. There will be a discount ranging from 1-10%, with the higher discounts awarded to those who participated earlier and/or contributed actively in the development of the project. 
   - All tokens will be issued following the successful completion of the fundraiser, with no lock-in.

**4. Commemorative NFT**
   - Each participant will receive a one-time, commemorative NFT to mark their involvement in this inaugural event. This NFT will be unique to the fundraiser and carry special significance as a founding supporter’s badge.
   
**5. Payment and Transaction**
   - All contributions must be made in CAD via the specified payment methods (e.g., credit card, e-transfer). Contributions are non-refundable except under circumstances where the fundraiser does not meet the minimum funding target or is otherwise cancelled.
   - T-Coin retains the right to reject contributions that do not meet minimum thresholds or violate these terms.

**6. Token Use and Redemption**
   - T-Coins acquired through this fundraiser will be usable across the T-Coin ecosystem, including with participating local merchants and services.
   - Redemption options will be provided, allowing participants to use T-Coins to support local charities, make purchases, or redeem at designated points within Toronto. Redemption may not be available immediately, but will be made available within 12 months from launch or earlier.

**7. Risks and Disclosures**
   - Participation in the T-Coin fundraiser carries inherent risks, including but not limited to market volatility, potential regulatory changes, and operational challenges. Participants acknowledge that they are assuming these risks by supporting the T-Coin initiative.
   - T-Coins are designed with demurrage. Participants acknowledge that this means that their tokens balance will reduce over time. At time of minting the demurrage rate is 1%, and this percentage can be updated by the community.
   - T-Coin is not responsible for the potential decline in value of tokens due to external factors.

**8. Compliance and Restrictions**
   - This fundraiser is subject to all applicable Canadian laws and regulations. Participants agree to abide by these regulations and understand that violating any provision may result in forfeiture of their T-Coins.

   - Personal information will be managed in accordance with T-Coin’s privacy policy, available on our website.

**10. Fundraiser Completion and Token Distribution**
   - Upon successful completion of the fundraiser, T-Coins and commemorative NFTs will be distributed to participants. The anticipated distribution date will be announced and may be subject to delays due to technical, operational, or regulatory factors.
