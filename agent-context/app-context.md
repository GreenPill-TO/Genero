# Application Context: Genero

## Vision
Genero is the infrastructure layer for local, community-owned currencies—"CityCoins"—that support sustainable, equitable local economies. It operationalizes theories like demurrage, price-pegging, and automatic philanthropy.

## Design Philosophy
- **Community-first**: The economy should serve people, not abstract financial institutions.
- **Locality as strength**: Money should circulate locally, and reflect real-life community needs.
- **Programmable impact**: Code automates donations, spending incentives, and trust.

## What Makes It Unique
- Every transaction routes 3% to a charity chosen by the user.
- Value is pegged to tangible, relatable goods (e.g., TTC fare).
- Unlike most crypto projects, speculation is discouraged; value is designed to be stable.

## Role of the Repo
Genero provides the UI and wallet infrastructure for communities to deploy their own currency systems. The Toronto Coin (T-Coin) pilot sets the blueprint.

## AI Agent Goals
When extending or improving Genero:
- Maintain modularity between cities and app types.
- Prioritize user trust, simplicity, and transparency.
- Ensure new logic aligns with economic goals (e.g., circulation, inclusion, price stability).
